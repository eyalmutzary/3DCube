# Overview
This Python project showcases a 3D cube rotation implemented entirely from scratch, without relying on external libraries. The unique twist here is that the cube's surface is defined using ASCII letters, adding an extra layer of challenge and creativity to the project. To achieve this, the code leverages concepts from linear algebra and employs screen pixel drawing algorithms to create the rotating cube effect.

# Features
- Pure Python Implementation: This project demonstrates the construction of a 3D cube without resorting to any external libraries or frameworks, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.

- ASCII Art: The cube's surfaces are defined using ASCII letters, making it visually intriguing and distinctive.

- Rotational Dynamics: The cube elegantly rotates in three-dimensional space, providing a captivating demonstration of linear algebra concepts such as matrix transformations and vector rotations.

- Pixel Drawing Algorithms: The code employs pixel drawing algorithms to render the cube on the screen, ensuring smooth and efficient visualization.

# Getting Started
